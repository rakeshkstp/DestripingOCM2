# Destriping Ocean Colour Monitor 2 Data.

## What is [Ocean Colour Monitor - 2](https://ioccg.org/sensor/ocm-2/)?
[Ocean Colour Monitor - 2 (OCM-2)](https://ioccg.org/sensor/ocm-2/) is a multispectral ocean colour sensor mounted on the Earth observing satellite [OceanSat-2](https://www.isro.gov.in/Spacecraft/oceansat-2) launched by [Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)](https://www.isro.gov.in/) in 2009. It is a sucessor to [OCM-1](https://ioccg.org/sensor/ocm/) which is a payload of [OceanSat (IRS-P4)](https://www.isro.gov.in/Spacecraft/oceansatirs-p4) launched in 1999. It records radiance data in the spectral range of 400nm to 900nm with 6 bands in the visible region and 2 bands in the near-infrared region.

## Why is [this destriping project](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asr.2018.03.021) needed?
OCM-2 data has been hampered by serious vertical striping artifacts as seen in the figure below.

The random unsystematic stripes and bandings on the scene edges affect both visual interpretation and radiometric integrity of remotely sensed data, contribute to confusion in the aerosol correction process, and multiply and propagate into higher level ocean color products generated by atmospheric correction and bio-optical algorithms.

## How to compile this project?

* Put all the scripts in a folder and run [compile.sh](https://github.com/rakeshkstp/DestripingOCM2/blob/main/compile.sh).

*Note that the C scripts used in this project are compiled using [h4cc compiler](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/man1/h4cc.1.html) to add support for OCM-2 
HDF-4 image files.*

* The compilation will create an executable file "DESTRIPE".
* If DESTRIPE is not executable, then run
```
 $ chmod +x DESTRIPE
```

* DESTRIPE takes OCM-2 L1B file as input and updates it with the destriped image file.
